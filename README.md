# Task 5 : 
Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark.

Objective: Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

Tools: Wireshark (free).

Deliverables: A packet capture (.pcap) file and a short report of protocols identified.

# Hints/Mini Guide:

1.Install Wireshark.

2.Start capturing on your active network interface.

3.Browse a website or ping a server to generate traffic.

4.Stop capture after a minute.

5.Filter captured packets by protocol (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP).

6.Identify at least 3 different protocols in the capture.

7.Export the capture as a .pcap file.

8.Summarize your findings and packet details.

Outcome: Hands-on packet analysis skills and protocol awareness.
